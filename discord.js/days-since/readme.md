## `Days Since` - the Discord Bot

A _light-weight_, __open-source__ __Discord__ bot written in `Discord.js` with `TypeScript` that is used to track the number of days since a desired date provided by the user.

### Usage

The usage is fairly simple.

```sh
@Days Since count `DD:MM:YY`
```
\*where `DD:MM:YY` is the date to track.
